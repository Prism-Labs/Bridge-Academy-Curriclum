On episode 46 of the podcast, in an interview with Sjors Provoost from the Netherlands who mentioned he had to learn C++ from the basics as this is the language bitcoin code is written in.
The Bitcoin technology is getting more complicated, with new work being built on the fundamentals until one day you have to rebuild the entire foundation. Reviews often can get in the way of each other because of the decentralized nature of the system. There are systems in place to avoid this (10:35-14:30).

Tales from the crypt is a podcast hosted by Marty Bent who usually has interesting people on to discuss bitcoin. On this episode, he has Yassine Elmandjra, Crypto analyst at ARK Invest to discuss topics ranging from bitcoin mining, how he started bitcoin and others. 
Bitcoin is bootstrapped to three main components;
i. Reward mechanism- rewarding honest node behavior during the consensus process
ii. Proof of work- deals with identity and civil attacks
iii. Nakamoto consensus- to prevent double spending
Mining started as a hobby among the first bitcoin adopters in 2009 and was done on desktop computers. In 2010, the trend shifted to GPUs. 2011 brought the FGEA based miners. Next, we saw the ASIC miners with efficiency now determined by how advanced the node is. 
Cost of mining is also affected by electricity costs. This has caused bitcoin miners to explore renewable energy. According to coin shares, bitcoin miners use 77% renewable energy compared to 18% average of other industries.

Core components of BTC
 Blockchain
 Proof of Work (5:29-8:16)
The Nakamoto Consensus prevents double spending in BTC while you need lot of trust that here is no double spending in a centralized system that we see in Central Banks and commercial banks. BTC not being able to print more than 21 million units makes it extremely scarce (22:3-22:47). Gold expands at about 1.6%/year while the rate of expansion of BTC gets lower every year. Can BTC value go to zero? (52:12-52:46)
Volatility is needed for BTC to actually become the global reserve. BTC aims to be a net positive volatile asset for this purpose

=== Why is Bitcoin volatile?
==== Emotions of bitcoin holders. When prices fall, people sell in panic
==== Bitcoin prices react to the news
==== Bitcoin was illiquid until recently. It was estimated that 4% people own about 95% of the BTC that has been mined. So, if someone wanted to buy a large quantity, there will not be enough, hence driving the price up

The Bitcoin Alert system was to communicate emergencies within the network to the participants that were authenticated and propagated from the 3 or 4 people with access to these keys. The problems arose because of the anonymity of some holders of this key. If they got compromised, someone could propagate a malicious message on this network, and it would get treated with importance.

BIPs (Bit Improvement Proposals) is what you need to propose changes to the blockchain. A prototype is usually made with the BIP and submitted. When it has passed as ready and good, it can be added to the live code.
A hard fork is an incompatible change in the rules while a soft fork is compatible. The hard fork is usually incompatible with the old version. People without technical knowledge can simply share knowledge and materials to help spread the ideology of BTC among the general public

Bitcoin, a unit of currency, is the collection of concept and technologies running through a digital money ecosystem in which users are connected through the internet made available by an open source software. Bitcoin was invented in 2008 by Satoshi Nakamoto, and the network started fully in 2009. Though virtual, bitcoin can be used as means of exchange for both high and low-value retail, offshore conduct services and payment means of import and export. A wallet address allows irreversible transactions to be carries out between users and typically starts with a 1 or a 3, there is also an option of scanning a QR code on a smartphone which corresponds to same wallet address of the user.

=== What are the difference between bitcoin and traditional currency?
==== Bitcoin is virtual, traditional currency isn’t
==== Bitcoin transactions are irreversible while traditional currency transactions are
==== Tradtional currency is centralized, Bitcoin is decentralized

== How Bitcoin Works

Link: https://github.com/bitcoinbook/bitcoinbook/blob/develop/ch02.asciidoc


A blockchain explore is a web app that operates as BTC search engine and allows to search for transactions, addresses and blocks to see relationship and flow between them. Inputs (debits) and outputs (credit) do not add up to same amount with outputs adding up less than inputs because of transaction fees collected by miners. A transaction forms a chain where the inputs from latest transaction correspond to outputs from previous transactions. Mining nodes validate all transactions by reference to bitcoin’s consensus rules. 

=== What does mining process do?
==== Mining achieves an excellent balance between cost and reward.
==== Mining nodes validate all transactions by reference to bitcoin’s consensus rules
==== It produces more BTC into the system at a steady rate until the market cap of 21 million is reached.

== Bitcoin Core: The Reference Implementation

Link: https://github.com/bitcoinbook/bitcoinbook/blob/develop/ch03.asciidoc

Bitcoin is an open source project meaning its simply free to use and also developed by an open community of volunteers. For a developer, there is need to set up a development environment with all the tools, libraries, and support software for writing bitcoin applications in order to access operating system’s command-line interface known as a shell, accessed via a terminal application through which series of commands and scripts can be run. 

=== Reasons for running a bitcoin node?
==== If a user does not want to rely on any third party to process or validate transactions.
==== If you are developing bitcoin software and need to rely on a bitcoin node for programmable (API)
==== Running a node makes the network more robust and able to serve more wallets, more users, and more transactions.

== Keys, Addresses

Link: https://github.com/bitcoinbook/bitcoinbook/blob/develop/ch04.asciidoc

Ownership of bitcoin is established through digital keys, bitcoin addresses, and digital signatures. The digital keys which can be generated and managed by the user’s wallet software without reference to the blockchain or access to the internet. Public key cryptography is used to create a key pair that controls access to bitcoin. The key pair consists of a private key and— derived from it— a public key that’s distinct. The private key must be backed up to prevent loss as this means funds secured by it are lost forever. 

=== Differences between a public and private key
==== The public key is used to receive funds while the private key is used to sign transactions to spend the funds
==== The public key can be calculated from a private key while a private key cannot be calculated from a public key
==== A private key is picked randomly while a public key is calculated from a private key

The wallet controls access to a user’s money, managing keys and addresses, tracking the balance, and creating and signing transactions. Depending on whether wallets are related to each other there are two primary types of wallets; nondeterministic wallet or JBOK (Just a bunch of keys) where each key is independently generated from a random number and keys are not related to each other and deterministic wallet where all the keys are derived from a single master key, known as the seed.

=== Common industry standard for bitcoin wallet technology?

== Transactions

Link: https://github.com/bitcoinbook/bitcoinbook/blob/develop/ch06.asciidoc

Transactions are data structures that encode the transfer of value between participants in the bitcoin system. The fundamental building block of a bitcoin transaction is a transaction output which are indivisible chunks of bitcoin currency, recorded on the blockchain, is recognized as valid by the entire network. The transaction involves pointer to an UTXO (unspent transaction output) by reference to the transaction hash and an output index, which identifies the specific UTXO in the transaction. This is followed by unlocking script, which the wallet constructs in order to satisfy the spending conditions set in the UTXO. Most times, the unlocking script is a digital signature and public key proving ownership of the bitcoin. 

=== What are the uses of a digital signature?
==== It proves that the owner of the private key, who is by implication the owner of the funds, has authorized the spending of those funds
==== It shows the proof of authorization is undeniable (nonrepudiation).
==== The signature proves that the transaction (or specific parts of the transaction) have not and cannot be modified by anyone after it has been signed.

== Advanced Transactions and Scripting

Link: https://github.com/bitcoinbook/bitcoinbook/blob/develop/ch07.asciidoc

Advanced transaction and scripting involve the use of multisignature scripts and Pay-to-Script-Hash. Multisignature scripts set a condition where some of public keys (N) are recorded in the script and some of the public keys (M) of those must provide signatures to unlock the funds. Pay to script hash simpliﬁes the use of complex transaction scripts With P2SH payments, the complex locking script is replaced with its digital ﬁngerprint, a cryptographic hash. 

=== What are the advantage of p2sh over multisignature?
==== P2SH can to encode a script hash as an address
==== Complex scripts are replaced by shorter ﬁngerprints in the transaction output, making the transaction smaller.
==== P2SH shifts the transaction fee cost of a long script from the sender to the recipient

== The Bitcoin Network
Link: https://github.com/bitcoinbook/bitcoinbook/blob/develop/ch08.asciidoc

Bitcoin is configured as a peer-to-peer (p2p protocol) network on the internet. There are no special nodes in bitcoin, and all nodes share equal responsibility but assume different function. Functions in nodes include a wallet, miner, full blockchain database, and network routing. A Bitcoin Relay Network are overlay networks that provide additional connectivity between nodes with specialized needs. 

=== What does the peer-to-peer network design mean?
==== It means that the computers that participate in the network are peers to each other
==== There is no server, no centralized service, and no hierarchy within the network
==== The network nodes interconnected in a mesh network with a ﬂat topology.

== The Blockchain

Link: https://github.com/bitcoinbook/bitcoinbook/blob/develop/ch09.asciidoc

The blockchain data structure is well arranged and connected list of blocks of transactions. Each block within the blockchain is identiﬁed by a hash. A block is a data structure that arranges transactions for inclusion in the blockchain. The block is made of a header, containing metadata and list of transactions.

=== How does one use a test chain?
==== Establish a development pipeline.
==== Switch to testnet to expose your code to a more dynamic environment
==== Once you are conﬁdent your code works as expected, switch to mainnet to deploy it in production.

== Mining and Consensus

Link: https://github.com/bitcoinbook/bitcoinbook/blob/develop/ch10.asciidoc

Mining is the mechanism that supports the decentralized clearinghouse, by which transactions are validated and cleared. Miners receive two types of rewards in return for the security provided by mining: new coins created with each new block, and transaction fees from all the transactions included in the block. The solution to the problem, called the Proof-of-Work, is included in the new block and acts as proof that the miner expended signiﬁcant computing effort. Every transaction may include a transaction fee, in the form of a surplus of bitcoin between the transaction’s inputs and outputs. The winning bitcoin miner gets to keep the change on the transactions included in the winning block. 

=== What are some of the criteria to be met before a block can be verified?
==== A matching transaction in the pool, or in a block in the main branch, must exist.
==== For each input, the referenced output must exist and cannot already be spent.
==== Reject if the sum of input values is less than the sum of output values.

== Bitcoin Security

Link: https://github.com/bitcoinbook/bitcoinbook/blob/develop/ch11.asciidoc

A decentralized system like bitcoin pushes the responsibility and control to the users. A very effective method for protecting bitcoin is to convert them into physical form. Bitcoin keys are nothing more than long numbers, and they can be stored in a physical form, such as printed on paper or etched on a metal coin. Keeping bitcoin ofﬂine is called cold storage and it is one of the most effective security techniques. Prudent users will keep only a small fraction, perhaps less than 5%, of their bitcoin in an online or mobile wallet as pocket change. The rest should be split between a different storage mechanisms. When storing large amounts of bitcoin, a multisignature bitcoin address should be considered. 

=== What are the things I should avoid when storing my bitcoin?
==== Do not store all your bitcoin in one wallet, diversify i.e put your bitcoin in different wallet
==== Do not take your transaction off blockchain because improperly secured centralized ledgers can be falsiﬁed, diverting funds and depleting reserves, unnoticed.
==== Unless you are prepared to invest heavily in operational security, multiple layers of access control, and audits, you should think very carefully before taking funds outside of bitcoin’s decentralized security context.

== Blockchain Applications

Link: https://github.com/bitcoinbook/bitcoinbook/blob/develop/ch12.asciidoc

The bitcoin blockchain can become an application platform offering trust services to applications, such as smart contracts, far surpassing the original purpose of digital currency and payments. Colored coins are used to track digital assets as well as physical assets held by third parties and traded through colored coins certiﬁcates of ownership while the Counterparty protocol, similar to colored coins, offers the ability to create and trade virtual assets and tokens. The Lightning Network is a proposed routed network of bidirectional payment channels connected end-to-end. A network like this can allow any participant to route a payment from channel to chan without trusting any of the intermediaries.

=== What are the guarantees offered by bitcoin?
==== Once a transaction is recorded in the blockchain and sufﬁcient work has been added with subsequent blocks, the transaction’s data becomes immutable.
==== Digital signatures, validated in a decentralized network, offer authorization guarantees.
==== A transaction can only spend existing, validated outputs. It is not possible to create or counterfeit value.
