== Docs

Link: https://ipfs.io/docs/

When you use IPFS, you don’t only download a file from someone else, but your computer can help distribute it, too — when your friend a few blocks away needs the same Wikipedia page, they might be as likely to get it from you like your neighbor.
IPFS makes this possible for web pages, but also for any file a computer might store, whether it’s an MS Word document, an e-mail, an MP3 file, or even a database record.


==== What is the difference between IPFS and MFS?

===== Files in IPFS are content-addressed and immutable; they can be complicated to edit. Mutable File System (MFS) is a tool built into IPFS that lets you treat files like you would a normal name-based filesystem — you can add, remove, move, and edit MFS files and have all the work of updating links and hashes taken care of for you
