== Ethereum Basics

Link: https://github.com/ethereumbook/ethereumbook/blob/develop/02intro.asciidoc

In this chapter, you set up a wallet using MetaMask and funded it using a faucet on the Ropsten test network. You received ether into your wallet’s Ethereum address; then you sent ether to the faucet’s Ethereum address.
 Ether is subdivided into smaller units, down to the smallest unit possible, which is named wei. One ether is 1 quintillion wei (1 * 1018 or 1,000,000,000,000,000,000).
 There are some wallets that supports operations in Ethereum such as MetaMask, Jaxx, MyEtherWallet (MEW). Emerald Wallet.

== Cryptography

Link: https://github.com/ethereumbook/ethereumbook/blob/develop/04keys-addresses.asciidoc

In this chapter, we provided a brief survey of public key cryptography and focused on the use of public and private keys in Ethereum and the use of cryptographic tools, such as hash functions, in the creation and verification of Ethereum addresses. We also looked at digital signatures and how they can demonstrate ownership of a private key without revealing that private key.


==== What is it an elliptic curve regarding cryptography?
===== Elliptic curve cryptography is a type of asymmetric or public key cryptography based on the discrete logarithm problem as expressed by addition and multiplication on the points of an elliptic curve.
===== Elliptic curve cryptography is a type of asymmetric or private key cryptography based on the discrete logarithm problem as expressed by addition and multiplication on the points of an elliptic curve.

Transactions are the starting point of every activity in the Ethereum system. Transactions are the inputs that cause the Ethereum Virtual Machine to evaluate contracts, update balances, and more generally modify the state of the Ethereum blockchain.

== Smart Contracts and Solidity

Link: https://github.com/ethereumbook/ethereumbook/blob/develop/07smart-contracts-solidity.asciidoc 


In this chapter, we started working with smart contracts in detail and explored the Solidity contract programming language. We took a simple example contract, Faucet.sol, and gradually improved it and made it more complicated, using it to explore various aspects of the Solidity language.

Vyper is a compelling and exciting new contract-oriented programming language. Its design is biased toward correctness, at the expense of some flexibility. This may allow programmers to write better smart contracts and avoid certain pitfalls that cause serious vulnerabilities to arise.

== Smart Contract Security 

Link: https://github.com/ethereumbook/ethereumbook/blob/develop/09smart-contracts-security.asciidoc 

There is a lot for any developer working in the smart contract domain to know and understand. By following best practices in your smart contract design and code writing, you will avoid many severe pitfalls and traps.
Perhaps the most fundamental software security principle is to maximize reuse of trusted code. In cryptography, this is so important it has been condensed into an adage: Don’t roll your crypto. In the case of smart contracts, this amounts to gaining as much as possible from freely available libraries that have been thoroughly vetted by the community.

== Oracles
Link: https://github.com/ethereumbook/ethereumbook/blob/develop/11oracles.asciidoc

Oracles provide a crucial service to smart contracts: they bring external facts to contract execution. With that, of course, oracles also introduce a significant risk—if they are trusted sources and can be compromised, they can result in compromised execution of the smart contracts they feed.


==== Why it is risky to use Oracles in the smart-contracts.
===== Smart-contracts can be exposed to potentially false inputs. 
===== They bring external facts to contract execution
